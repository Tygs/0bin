***WARNING*: 0bin.net is dead and will stay that way. We got a surge in CP report and decided to not keep it up. It was to be expected, and we always had to perform some take down, but this is now too much.

The code stays available if you choose to host your own instance.*


0bin: a client side encrypted pastebin
===========================================

0bin is a pastebin that encrypts the user content in the browser and can run without a database.

* Try it: `0bin.net <http://0bin.net>`_
* `Report a bug <https://github.com/sametmax/0bin/issues>`_

0bin allows anybody to host a pastebin while welcoming any type of content to
be pasted in it. The idea is that one can (probably...) not be legally entitled
to `moderate the pastebin content`_ as they have no way to decrypt it.

It's an Python implementation of the `zerobin project`_, created by sebsauvage, under the `WTFPL licence`_.

To run zerobin, download zerobin.pyz from the latest release_ then:

::

    python zerobin.pyz

0bin requires Python 3.7 or higher.

You may need to type :code:`py -3.7 zerobin.pyz` on Windows, or :code:`python3.7 zerobin.pyz` on Mac/Linux, depending on your configuration.

If you are familiar with the Python ecosystem, you can also :code:`python -m pip install zerobin --user` and run :code:`python -m zerobin` for the same effect.


How it works
=============

When creating the paste:

- the browser generates a random key;
- the pasted content is encrypted with this key using AES256;
- the encrypted pasted content is sent to the server;
- the browser receives the paste URL and adds the key in the URL hash (#).

When reading the paste:

- the browser makes the GET request to the paste URL;
- because the key is in the hash, the key is not part of the request;
- browser gets the encrypted content end decrypts it using the key;
- the pasted decrypted content is displayed and sourcecode is highlighted.

Key points:

- because the key is in the hash, the key is never sent to the server;
- therefore it won't appear in the server logs;
- all operations, including code coloration, happen on the client-side;
- the server is no more than a fancy recipient for the encrypted data.

Other features
======================

- automatic code coloration (no need to specify the language);
- pastebin expiration: 1 day, 1 month or never;
- burn after reading: the paste is destroyed after the first reading;
- clone paste: you can't edit a paste, but you can duplicate any of them;
- code upload: if a file is too big, you can upload it instead of using copy/paste;
- copy paste to clipboard in a click;
- own previous pastes history;
- reader mode;

Known issues
============

- 0bin uses several HTML5/CSS3 features that are not widely supported. In that case we handle the degradation as gracefully as we can.
- The pasted content size limit check is not accurate. It's just a safety net, so we think it's ok.
