      <h4>What is Bitcoin?</h4>

        <p>Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team who outlined the technology in a 2008 white paper. It’s an appealingly simple concept: <strong>bitcoin is digital money</strong> that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on the traditional financial system for permission to transfer money and on existing debit/credit accounts, bitcoin is decentralized: any two people, anywhere in the world, can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank, government, or other institution.
        <p>
        Every transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a bank’s ledger, or log of customers’ funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it’s a record of every transaction ever made using bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
        There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This is digital money that cannot be inflated or manipulated in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
        It isn’t necessary to buy an entire bitcoin: you can buy just a fraction of one if that’s all you want or need.
        </p>
